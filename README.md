# iaac-data-fabric: Because Wrangling Data Shouldn't Involve Actual Wrangling (Unless You're Into That)

This repository houses the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for a gloriously over-engineered (but totally necessary) data fabric on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  Because why just *move* data when you can *choreograph* its movement with the complexity of a symphony orchestra?

**What's in this digital data-woven tapestry?**

*   **Synchronous & Asynchronous Ingestion:** We've got both! Because sometimes you need data *now*, and sometimes you're cool with waiting a bit.  Think of it as the difference between ordering a pizza and waiting for your grandma to bake you cookies. Both delicious, but different timelines.
*   **Structured & Unstructured Data Support:**  Because data doesn't always play nice.  Whether it's neatly organized in rows and columns or a wild, untamed beast of text and images, we can handle it.  We're basically data zookeepers.
*   **Hybrid Connectivity:**  Bridging the gap between your on-prem data dungeon and the cloud's shiny palace. Because sometimes, legacy systems are like that weird uncle you have to invite to the family reunion.
*   **Analytics, Operational, and AI Workloads:**  This data fabric is versatile.  Whether you want to build fancy dashboards, keep your business running smoothly, or train the next Skynet (for purely benevolent purposes, of course), we've got you covered.
*   **Data Catalog:**  Because knowing where your data is hiding is half the battle.  Think of it as the Dewey Decimal System for the digital age.
*   **API Management:**  So you can access your data with the elegance of a well-crafted API call.  No more messy SQL queries in the dark!

** Components **

- Cloud Storage
- BigQuery
- Dataflow
- Pub/Sub
- DataPlex
- Apigee
- Looker

**Why did we build this?**

Because data is the new oil, and we're here to refine it (and maybe spill a little in the process).

**How to Deploy (if you dare):**

1.  Clone this repository (obviously).
2.  Have a GCP project ready (and a fat wallet).
3.  Run the Terraform scripts (and pray).
4.  Cross your fingers and hope everything works.

**Contributing:**

If you find a bug, please submit an issue (or better yet, a pull request with a fix).  If you want to add a new feature, please submit a pull request (and prepare for some *spirited* code reviews).
